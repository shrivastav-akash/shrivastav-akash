Hi, I am @shrivastav-akash
I am a student at Presidency University pursuing B.tech in Computer Engineering.
I have a keen interest in research related to open-source methodologies and find the collaborative work culture, where individuals from diverse geographical locations and time zones interact and exchange knowledge, to be particularly intriguing.
I'm currently learning Python, and SQL on the side, I am also working on developing my skills to solve DSA-based problems.
I'm looking to collaborate on end-to-end development-related projects to understand the behind-the-scenes of deploying software or solutions to solve real-life problems.
